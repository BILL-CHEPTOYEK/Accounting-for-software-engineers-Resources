# 04-Application

Welcome to the application folder for our complete accounting system. This is where we'll bring all the foundational concepts and database designs to life. The goal is to build a full-stack application that provides a practical, working example of a double-entry bookkeeping system.

This directory will be broken down into a backend and a frontend, each with its own specific purpose.

---

### Backend: The Financial Core

The backend will be responsible for all financial logic and data management. It will house the API that interacts directly with our database.

* **Technology Stack**: We will use [Your Backend Technology Here, e.g., Python with Django/FastAPI, Node.js with Express] to build a robust and scalable API.
* **Key Functionalities**:
    * **Transaction Management**: API endpoints to create, retrieve, and manage financial transactions.
    * **Financial Reporting**: Logic to generate key reports like a Balance Sheet and Income Statement.
    * **Ledger Queries**: Functions to query the transaction history and calculate account balances.

### Frontend: The User Interface

The frontend will provide a clean and intuitive user interface for interacting with the backend APIs. It will be the visual representation of our accounting system.

* **Technology Stack**: We will use [Your Frontend Technology Here, e.g., React, Vue.js, or a static site generator].
* **Key Functionalities**:
    * **Dashboard**: A summary view of the company's financial health.
    * **Transaction Form**: A user-friendly form to create and submit new transactions.
    * **Report Viewers**: Interactive pages to display the Balance Sheet and Income Statement.

### Getting Started

To get the application up and running, follow these steps:

1.  Set up the database using the SQL scripts from the `02-Database-Design/` and `03-scripts/` directories.
2.  Navigate to the `backend/` folder, install the dependencies, and start the API server.
3.  Navigate to the `frontend/` folder, install the dependencies, and launch the development server.

Let's start building!
