# Accounting for Software Engineers: Resources üë®‚Äçüíª

I‚Äôve been there. You're building a system, let's say one that tracks company expenses, and it all seems straightforward at first. You create tables for expenses, users, and categories. But as the project grows, you start to hit walls. You need to handle reversals, categorize transactions correctly, and, most importantly, generate reports that actually make sense to the finance team. Every time you solve one problem, it feels like you've created another, often due to a lack of fundamental accounting knowledge.

That was my reality. I quickly realized that to build a robust financial system, I couldn't just write code; I had to learn accounting. With the guidance of a patient superior, I began to unravel the concepts of debits, credits, and the Chart of Accounts. It was a steep learning curve, made even steeper by the scarcity of resources that catered specifically to a software engineer's mindset. Most accounting guides were dense, full of jargon, and assumed a level of prior knowledge I just didn't have.

This repository is the solution to that problem. I created this guide to bridge the gap between engineering and accounting. My goal is to simplify the learning process by providing clear, practical, and code-centric resources. This is the guide I wish I had when I started‚Äîa place where you can learn the "why" behind accounting principles and immediately see the how in code and database design.
